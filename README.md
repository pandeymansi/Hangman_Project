# Hangman_Project
A simple Hangman game implemented in Python. The game selects a random word from a predefined list and allows the player to guess the word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.

## Files Needed
The main Python file (`hangman_project.py`) requires two external files:
1. `word_file.py` - A Python file containing a list of random words.
2. `hangman_stages.py` - A Python file containing the stages of the Hangman game.

**Ensure the External Files are in Place**:
- **word_file.py**: Ensure this file is in the same directory as `hangman_project.py`.
- **hangman_stages.py**: Ensure this file is in the same directory as `hangman_project.py`.
